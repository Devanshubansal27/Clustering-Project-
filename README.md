# A Data Driven Approach to Fund Allocation for Help International NGO

**Introduction**

The objective of the project was to segment countries into clusters based on socio-economic and health indicators, allowing Help International to determine which countries require more aid. By analyzing these clusters, we aimed to develop a data-driven approach to fund distribution, ensuring that countries with the greatest need receive more resources.
